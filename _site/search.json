Then on Thursday and Friday, these groups played the POT game levels on Thursday and Friday and took the POT posttest on Friday.\nStudents in Groups B, D, and E reversed the ordering of the ECT and POT levels. Playing POT game levels on Tuesday and Wednesday, taking the POT posttest on Wednesday, playing ECT game levels on Thursday and Friday, and taking the ECT posttest on Friday.\nDue to a mix-up during the construction of the post-test for the Affective Support Study, Form A items were used for both the pretest and posttest. At least two days of gameplay occured between the two uses."
