Then on Thursday and Friday, these groups played the POT game levels on Thursday and Friday and took the POT posttest on Friday.\nStudents in Groups B, D, and E reversed the ordering of the ECT and POT levels. Playing POT game levels on Tuesday and Wednesday, taking the POT posttest on Wednesday, playing ECT game levels on Thursday and Friday, and taking the ECT posttest on Friday.\nDue to a mix-up during the construction of the post-test for the Affective Support Study, Form A items were used for both the pretest and posttest. At least two days of gameplay occured between the two uses."

    "text": "Overview\nProject\nGame Design\nCognitive Supports\n\nAs part of the project, the team designed and developed a set of in-game cognitive supports. The iterative design and development process used is described in Shute, Smith et al. (2020)\n\n\nFinal set of in-game cognitive supports (1) physics videos, (2) interactive definitions, (3) formulas, (4) Hewitt videos, (5) glossary, (6) worked examples, (7) hints, and (8) game tips.\nFinal Cognitive Support Design\n\n\n\n\nA diagram of a company Description automatically generated\n\n\nAffective Supports\nPhysics Assessments\nPhysics Understanding Test\n\nResearch Studies: Game Design and Usability, Cognitive Supports, Learning and Stealth Assessment Research Studies\nOverview: We created 36 illustrative multiple-choice items covering the nine physics competencies in the game, counterbalanced between two equivalent forms for a pretest and posttest (pretest = 18 items, α = .77; posttest = 18 items, α = .82). Each form includes two items per competency. The items were (a) designed in the context of the game (i.e., including a video or an image from the game environment), (b) developed with the help of two physics experts, and (c) subjected to several pilot tests before administration in the current study.\n\n\nPhysics Understanding Test\n\n\nResearch Studies: Affective Supports, Support Timing, Support Efficacy\nWe created two isomorphic forms each including 28 illustrative multiple-choice items (Form A = 28 items, Cronbach’s α = 0.80; Form B = 28 items, Cronbach’s α = 0.83) covering the two physics competencies in (i.e., ECT and POT). Each form included 14 near-transfer items (designed in the context of the game) and 14 far-transfer items, designed to resemble the Force Concept Inventory (Hestenes et al., 1992); These items were developed with the help of two physics experts and subjected to several pilot tests.\n\nGame\nHow to use\nGameplay\nIncentives\nSupports\nCognitive Supports\nAffective Supports\nStealth Assessment\nCompetency Model\nEvidence Model\nEvidence Identification\nStatistics\nQMatrix\nResearch Studies\nSupport Timing (see Rahimi, Shute, et. al., 2022)\nDue to the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, all research was conducted online. We collected data from five cohorts of middle and high school students between the Spring and Fall of 2020. Data were collected from 204 participants, of which 149 were analyzed here. The first cohort (n = 12) participated as a remote after-school program (students were from across the US), the second (n = 16), and fourth (n = 12) cohorts participated as a remote activity related to their class (i.e., students of this cohort were classmates), the third (n = 69) cohort’s students were also classmates and had an option to participate remotely from home or come to their class wearing masks (everyone had to login via Zoom; researchers collected the data remotely with the help of teachers), and the fifth cohort (n = 40) participated as a remote summer camp program. Students’ ages ranged from 12 to 17 years, and the sample was diverse with respect to ethnicity and gender. Students who completed the study received a certificate of participation in addition to other performance-based incentives.\nWe used a between-subjects pretest-posttest design. Students were randomly assigned into one of three conditions: (1) Before (n = 50): in which supports (i.e., Physics Videos) were delivered before students started a level; (2) After (n = 46): in which supports were delivered after students solved or quit a level; and (3) Control (n = 53): in which students did not receive supports during gameplay.\nStudents assigned to the Before condition received a message encouraging them to watch a physics video (i.e., support) to help them prepare for and solve the level they were about to enter. Students in the After condition received a message when they solved or quit a level that encouraged them to watch a physics video (i.e., support) that could help them solve similar levels in the game.\nThe game version for this study included five tutorial levels, two warmup levels, and 28 game levels with various difficulties targeting the two physics concepts of energy can transfer (ECT) and properties of torque (POT). We ordered all the levels from easy to difficult (r = .62 between level number and difficulty) to ease students’ entry into the game and ordered them in a way that students alternated between the two concepts (ECT or POT). We also counterbalanced the ordering of levels with associated supports in that half the students in each treatment condition saw the supports in one set of 14 levels, and the other half saw the supports in the other set of 14 levels. In total, 35 levels were grouped within one large playground. Students played through these levels during individual gameplay sessions. Students could freely navigate through the game levels, although the game levels were presented to them in a predetermined order.\nWe included each support (i.e., physics video) in two of the relevant game levels to potentially increase exposure to the support and facilitate generalization since the same support can be useful for multiple levels. Also, students were required to watch the entire physics video the first time it was presented to them during gameplay. Specifically, the game was programmed to: (a) check if the student was viewing the physics video for the first time, and (b) if a was true then the game would wait until the physics video was completed before providing a button to allow the students close the video window. In all subsequent views of the physics video, students could close the video at will. Students always had access to Hints during gameplay. Students could also access Game Tips.\nMeasurement instruments included content (i.e., physics understanding), affect (i.e., intrinsic motivation inventory), and game data. The game records player actions and gameplay events into log files, such as: the number of levels solved, number of gold coins, number of silver coins, engagement with the physics videos (i.e., duration of views), and duration of gameplay. We parsed and extracted these data from log files for analysis."

    "text": "Physics Playground (PP) is a 2D computer game designed to assess and support students’ understanding of qualitative physics in real-time. The game covers 9 key physics competencies (e.g., Newton’s 3 Laws of Force & Motion). The goal in every game level is to guide a green ball to hit a red balloon. Players are free to choose any of the 110 game levels to play with two types of levels to choose from. In sketching levels, players draw simple machines to solve levels. In manipulation levels, players adjust physics parameters to solve levels. Students use of the game level’s physics in their solutions is rewarded with gold coins. The most recent focus was on designing and embedding various cognitive supports (e.g., short physics videos, like this one on potential energy) and affective supports (e.g., like this breathing exercise).

Moreover, we finalized a quit-prediction model to help determine if a student is going to quit in the next 20 seconds.

The current version was written by Weinan Zhang and Ahmad Rahimi based on an older (2014) C++ version written by Matthew Small and Matthew Ventura. Contact us if you would like access to the source code.\nPhysics Playground uses a client-server architecture. The client logs into the machine with a web browser (most modern browsers which support ECMAScript should work). After validating the user’s credentials, it sends down a package which contains the game engine and levels.\nOn the server, game levels are grouped into playgrounds. Each user ID is given a sequence of playgrounds that they should play through. In the current incarnation, user IDs need to be created on the server and associated with the relevant playgrounds.\nThe client (in the player’s web browser) periodically send information back to the server about the players progress. This is logged using Learning Locker.\n\n\nLevel Editor\n\n\nCurrent Game Levels"
