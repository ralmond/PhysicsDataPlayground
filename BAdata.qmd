# Data from the Before/After Study

The amount of data is rather large, so it is split into several files.
The variable `StudyID` is a primary key which can be used to join the data sets together.

## Pretest, Posttest and Questionnaires

This data file contains demographic data about the participants, pretest data,
posttest data, and the IMI and PA questionnares.

## Bayesian Network Scores

Bayesian network sheet contains the scores from running the Bayesian network engine.  

The `context` column is the last level played by that player.  

The `EAP` (expected _a posteriori_) scores run from
-1 (low) to 1 (high).  These are based on an average of the corresponding `Margin.High`, `Margin.Medium`, and `Margin.Low` scores.

## Observables (First and Last)

The observables tables record per-level information.  This is presented in "wide" format,
so the column names consist of _game level\_variable_.  

The player may have played the game multiple times; in this case, the "First" sheet gives
the values associated with the first attempt, and the "Last" gives the value associated
with the last attempt.

## Learning Supports

This data set records the usage of learning supports.  The available learning supports are:

* game tools
* hint
* physics animation: ramp
* physics animation: lever
* physics animation: pendulum
* physics animation: springboard

Not all learning supports are available on all levels.  In particular, the animations are
associated with levels which use that particular agent of motion.

## Full Join

Joining all of the above data sets produces a rather large file.  Here it is in both `csv`
(comma separated value) and `sav` (SPSS) formats.
