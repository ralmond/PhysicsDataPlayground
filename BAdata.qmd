# Data from the Before/After Study

The amount of data is rather large, so it is split into several files.
The variable `StudyID` is a primary key which can be used to join the data sets together.

## Pretest, Posttest and Questionnaires

This data file contains demographic data about the participants, pretest data,
posttest data, and the IMI and PA questionnaires.

Column types for pre-post data.

```{r}
ppkey <- "cccfffiiltff"
```

## Bayesian Network Scores

Bayesian network sheet contains the scores from running the Bayesian network engine.  

The `context` column is the last level played by that player.  

The `EAP` (expected _a posteriori_) scores run from
-1 (low) to 1 (high).  These are based on an average of the corresponding `Margin.High`, `Margin.Medium`, and `Margin.Low` scores.

## Observables (First and Last)

The observables tables record per-level information.  This is presented in "wide" format,
so the column names consist of _game level\_variable_.  

The player may have played the game multiple times; in this case, the "First" sheet gives
the values associated with the first attempt, and the "Last" gives the value associated
with the last attempt.  For the trophies only, there is another data set which gives
the best trophy obtained.

## Learning Supports

This data set records the usage of learning supports.  The available learning supports are:

* game tools
* hint
* physics animation: ramp
* physics animation: lever
* physics animation: pendulum
* physics animation: springboard

The total time spent on each learning support, and the number of times it was 
accessed are also provided.

Not all learning supports are available on all levels.  In particular, the animations are
associated with levels which use that particular agent of motion.

## Full Join

Joining all of the above data sets produces a rather large file.  Here it is in both `csv`
(comma separated value) and `sav` (SPSS) formats.
