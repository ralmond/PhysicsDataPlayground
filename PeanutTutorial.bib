  abstract = {Game-based assessments produce multiple, dependent observations from student game play. Bayesian networks can model the dependence, but, typically, only a small amount of pilot data are available at the time the network is constructed. This paper examines the process of creating Bayesian network scoring models, focusing on several practical techniques that have been used in the construction of models for Physics Playground. In particular, the following techniques are helpful: (1) The use of evidence-centered assessment design to define latent competency variables and observable indicator variables. (2) The use of correlation matrixes to uncover and validate the conditional independence structure of the Bayes net. (3) The use of discrete IRT models to create large portion of the Bayesian networks from a single spreadsheet. (4) Adjusting the Bayes net parameters using both hand tuning and a generalized EM algorithm, creating networks which are a mixture of expert opinion and data. (5) Using expected classification accuracy matrixes to judge assessment validity and reliability. (6) Using evidence balance sheets to identify unusual subjects and observable indicators.},

  abstract = {Latent class models are powerful tools in psychological and educational measurement. These models classify individuals into subgroups based on a set of manifest variables, assisting decision making in a diagnostic system. In this article, based on information theory, the authors propose a mutual information reliability (MIR) coefficient that summaries the measurement quality of latent class models, where the latent variables being measured are categorical. The proposed coefficient is analogous to a version of reliability coefficient for item response theory models and meets the general concept of measurement reliability in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. The proposed coefficient can also be viewed as an extension of the McFadden's pseudo R-square coefficient, which evaluates the goodness-of-fit of logistic regression model, to latent class models. Thanks to several information-theoretic inequalities, the MIR coefficient is unitless, lies between 0 and 1, and receives good interpretation from a measurement point of view. The coefficient can be applied to both fixed and computerized adaptive testing designs. The performance of the MIR coefficient is demonstrated by simulated examples.},

  abstract = {Despite the growing popularity of diagnostic classification models (e.g., Rupp, Templin, \& Henson, 2010) in educational and psychological measurement, methods for testing their absolute goodness-of-fit to real data remain relatively underdeveloped. For tests of reasonable length and for realistic sample size, full-information test statistics such as Pearson's {$\mathsl{X}$}2 and the likelihood ratio statistic {$\mathsl{G}$}2 suffer from sparseness in the underlying contingency table from which they are computed. Recently, limited-information fit statistics such as Maydeu-Olivares and Joe's (2006) {$\mathsl{M}$}2 have been found to be quite useful in testing the overall goodness-of-fit fit of item response theory (IRT) models. In this study, we applied Maydeu-Olivares and Joe's (2006) {$\mathsl{M}$}2 statistic to diagnostic classification models. Through a series of simulation studies, we found that {$\mathsl{M}$}2 is well calibrated across a wide range of diagnostic model structures and was sensitive to certain misspecifications of the item model (e.g., fitting disjunctive models to data generated according to a conjunctive model), errors in the Q-matrix (adding or omitting paths, omitting a latent variable), and violations of local item independence due to unmodeled testlet effects. On the other hand, {$\mathsl{M}$}2 was largely insensitive to misspecifications in the distribution of higherorder latent dimensions and to the specification of an extraneous attribute. To complement the analyses of the overall model goodness-of-fit using {$\mathsl{M}$}2, we investigated the utility of the Chen and Thissen (1997) local dependence statistic {$\mathsl{X}\mathsl{L}$}2{$\mathsl{D}$} for characterizing sources of misfit, an important aspect of model appraisal often overlooked in favor of overall statements. The {$\mathsl{X}\mathsl{L}$}2{$\mathsl{D}$} statistic was found to be slightly conservative (with Type I error rates consistently below the nominal level) but still useful in pinpointing the sources of misfit. Patterns of local dependence arising due to specific model misspecifications are illustrated. Finally, we used the {$\mathsl{M}$}2 and {$\mathsl{X}\mathsl{L}$}2{$\mathsl{D}$} statistics to evaluate a diagnostic model fit to data from the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), drawing upon analyses previously conducted by Lee, Park, and Taylan (2011).},

Careful design can support a person's learning by tailoring the features of situations to his or her skill level(s), allowing repeated attempts, and by providing timely feedback. Furthermore, simulations can emulate certain environments, which in turn, provide opportunities for assessing people's capabilities to act in these situations. This report describes an assessment design framework that can help projects develop effective simulation-based assessments. The report reviews the rationale and terminology of the `evidence centered' assessment design (ECD) framework (Mislevy, Steinberg, \& Almond, 2003), discusses how the framework aligns with the principles of simulation design, and illustrates the ideas it presents with examples from the fields of engineering and medicine. Advice is offered for designing a new simulation-based assessment and for adapting an existing simulation system for assessment purposes.},

A number of aspects of model fit, those of usual interest to practitioners, are assessed using various diagnostic tools. This article suggests a direct data display for assessing overall fit, suggests several diagnostics for assessing item fit, suggests a graphical approach to examine if the model can explain the association among the items, and suggests a version of the Mantel-Haenszel statistic for assessing differential item functioning. Limited simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested model diagnostics.}

Despite their use, the reliability of examinee estimates in DCM applications has seldom been reported. In this paper, a reliability measure for the categorical latent variables of DCMs is defined. Using theory- and simulation-based results, we show how DCMs uniformly provide greater examinee estimate reliability than IRT models for tests of the same length, a result that is a consequence of the smaller range of latent variable values examinee estimates can take in DCMs. We demonstrate this result by comparing DCM and IRT reliability for a series of models estimated with data from an end-of-grade test, culminating with a discussion of how DCMs can be used to change the character of large scale testing, either by shortening tests that measure examinees unidimensionally or by providing more reliable multidimensional measurement for tests of the same length.},
