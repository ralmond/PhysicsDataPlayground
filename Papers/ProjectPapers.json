  {"id":"rahimi2021c","abstract":"Persistence is an important part of student success—both in and out of school. To enhance persistence, we first need to assess it accurately. Digital games can be used as vehicles for measuring and enhancing persistence. The purpose of this study is to test the effects of (a) game-level characteristics (i.e., game mechanics and conceptual difficulty), and (b) student-related characteristics (e.g., students’ incoming knowledge and gender) on persistence in a game called Physics Playground. The participants in this study were 137, eighth and ninth-grade students from a K-12 school in Florida. We used a Hierarchical Linear Modeling Approach (HLM) to analyze the data. The major findings are (1) the degree of difficulty relating to both the physics concepts and game mechanics of each game problem are significant predictors of persistence, with the former being more effective than the latter in predicting students’ persistence, and (2) the number of gold and silver trophies students attained in the game were the only significant student-level predictors of persistence. We conclude by discussing the findings, the implications, limitations, and future research related to this study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Rahimi","given":"Seyedahmad"},{"family":"Shute","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qian"}],"citation-key":"rahimi2021c","container-title":"International Journal of Technology in Education and Science","container-title-short":"IJTES","DOI":"10.46328/ijtes.118","ISSN":"2651-5369","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"note":"https://www.ijtes.org/index.php/ijtes/article/view/118","page":"141-165","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Effects of Game and Student Characteristics on Persistence in Educational Games: A Hierarchical Linear Modeling Approach","title-short":"The Effects of Game and Student Characteristics on Persistence in Educational Games","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://myweb.fsu.edu/vshute/pdf/HLM.pdf","volume":"5"},

Using a game called\n              Physics Playground\n              , we randomly assigned 263 ninth‐ to eleventh‐grade students into four groups: adaptive, linear, free choice and no‐treatment control. Each condition had access to the same in‐game learning supports during gameplay. Results showed that: (a) the stealth assessment estimates of physics understanding were valid—significantly correlating with the external physics test scores; (b) there was no significant effect of game‐level delivery method on students' learning; and (c) physics animations were the most effective (among eight supports tested) in predicting both learning outcome and in‐game performance (e.g. number of game levels solved). We included student enjoyment, gender and ethnicity in our analyses as moderators to further investigate the research questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Shute","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Rahimi","given":"Seyedahmad"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Ginny"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Fengfeng"},{"family":"Almond","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Chih‐Pu"},{"family":"Kuba","given":"Renata"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhichun"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaotong"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Chen"}],"citation-key":"shute2021b","container-title":"Journal of Computer Assisted Learning","container-title-short":"Computer Assisted Learning","DOI":"10.1111/jcal.12473","ISSN":"0266-4909, 1365-2729","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","note":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcal.12473","page":"127-141","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Maximizing learning without sacrificing the fun: Stealth assessment, adaptivity and learning supports in educational games","title-short":"Maximizing learning without sacrificing the fun","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://myweb.fsu.edu/vshute/pdf/JCAL2020.pdf","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"smith2022","abstract":"The present study explores how gender, ethnicity, and performance-based perceived competence impact students’ learning, performance, and enjoyment from playing a digital STEM learning game. We had 199 9th-11th grade students play a 2D digital STEM learning game across six science classes. Based on the results of demographic surveys, matched pretests and posttests, and satisfaction questionnaires, we found no interaction between gender and ethnicity for performance-based perceived competence, performance, and enjoyment. We found a significant difference between males and females in performance-based perceived competence and in-game performance both favoring males over females. Among ethnic groups, we found a significant difference with in-game performance favoring White and Hispanic students over Black/African American students. However, the differences in gender and in ethnicity were insignificant once we controlled for both perceived competence and pretest scores. This supports the idea that neither race nor gender truly influence one’s ability to perform in digital learning games.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Ginny"},{"family":"Fulwider","given":"Curt"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhichun"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Shute","given":"Valerie J."},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiawei"}],"citation-key":"smith2022","container-title":"International Journal of Game-Based Learning","DOI":"10.4018/IJGBL.294013","ISSN":"2155-6849, 2155-6857","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"language":"ng","note":"https://myweb.fsu.edu/vshute/pdf/competence.pdf\nhttps://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJGBL.294013","page":"1-17","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Examining Students' Perceived Competence, Gender, and Ethnicity in a Digital STEM Learning Game:","title-short":"Examining Students' Perceived Competence, Gender, and Ethnicity in a Digital STEM Learning Game","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://myweb.fsu.edu/vshute/pdf/competence.pdf","volume":"12"},
