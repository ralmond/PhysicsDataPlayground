title: "Learning Support Reactions"
---

The PA (physics animation) gives the players response to the
learning supports, particularly the physics animations.  All items
were given on a 5-point Likeart scale:

"Strongly Agree" (1), "Somewhat agree" (2), "Neither agree nor disagree" (3), "Somewhat disagree" (4), "Strongly disagree" (5)

```{r PAscale}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
PA <- readr::read_csv("Instruments/KeysAndCodes_PA.csv")
knitr::kable(PA[,3:1])
```
The PA scale was given twice, once with the ECT posttest, and
once with the PA posttest.  In the data files, `PAX` is the
version given with the ECT test and `PAX.pot` is the version
given with the POT test.  

Note that students in some study conditions received the ECT test
midweek and the POT test at the end of the week, with the others
having the opposite order.  The `Midtest` and `Posttest` columns
in the data file indicate the sequencing of the two tests.
