## IDs

`StudyID`
: Main study ID and primary key.  First letter is study condition.

`ID1`, `ID2`
: Internal game IDs, first letter (following the 3 digits) is study condition.


## Study Conditions _Ginny_

The study was divided into two intervention/data collection periods, and the content into
two topics:  `ECT` -- Evidence Can Transfer, and `POT` -- Properties of Torque.

`Midtest`
: Which topic was addressed in the first study period (and the first (mid) posttest).  One of `ECT`, `POT`.

`Posttest`
: Which topic was addressed in the second study period (and the final posttest).

`Condition`
: One of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, or `F` giving the study condition (see [protocl](SupportEfficacy.qmd)

`CognitiveSupport`
: Did the student have access to cognitive supports?  (Logical)

`AffectiveECD` [sic]
: Did the student have access to affective supports during the period in which `ECT`
was the topic

`AffectivePOT`
: Did the student have access to affective supports during the period in which `POT`
was the topic

The following table summarizes the relationship between these treatment values.

Condition | Midtest | Posttest | CognitiveSupports | AffectiveECD | AffectivePOT
--------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------
 A        | ECT     | POT      | TRUE              | FALSE        | TRUE
 B        | POT     | ECT      | TRUE              | TRUE         | FALSE
 C        | ECT     | POT      | TRUE              | TRUE         | FALSE
 D        | POT     | ECT      | TRUE              | FALSE        | TRUE
 E        | POT     | ECT      | FALSE             | FALSE        | FALSE
 F        | ECT     | POT      | FALSE             | FALSE        | FALSE


## Demographic Varibles



`Age`
: Self-reported age in years.

`Sex`, `Gender`
: Self-reported gender

The race/ethnicity question was a check all that applied.  Respondents may have 
chosen more than one category.

`American Indian or Alaskan Native`, `Asian`, `Black or African American`, `Hispanic`, `Hawaiian or Pacific Islander`, `White`, `Other (enter)`, `Prefer not to say`
: Logical value giving selected race/ethnicity

`Other_TEXT`
: Text string entered for "Other".

`Ethnicity`
: If single option was selected, that option.  If multiple options selected, then `Mixed`.

`Gaming`
: "How often do you play video games?"  Ordinal, possible values:   
`Never`,	`Once a month or less`,	`Once a week`,	`3-4 times a week`,	`Every day`

`Physics`
: "Have you studied Physics?" Possible answers `Yes`, `No`.
