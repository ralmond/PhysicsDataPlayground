# Physics Playround:  An educational game to promote physics understanding

## Intervention:

[*Physics Playground*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqIY9x5dUf0)
(_PP_) is a 2D computer game designed to assess and support students'
understanding of qualitative physics in real-time. The game covers 9
key physics competencies (e.g., Newton's 3 Laws of Force &
Motion). The goal in every game level is to guide a green ball to hit
a red balloon. Players are free to choose any of the 110 game levels
to play with two types of levels to choose from. In [sketching
levels](https://youtu.be/qiYtPngpUpA), players draw simple machines to
solve levels. In [manipulation levels](https://youtu.be/K7trh3Gkuug),
players adjust physics parameters to solve levels. Students use of the
game level's physics in their solutions is rewarded with gold
coins. The most recent focus was on designing and embedding various
cognitive supports (e.g., short physics videos, like this one on
[potential
energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIyqwOfhxgE&feature=youtu.be))
and affective supports (e.g., like this [breathing
exercise](https://youtu.be/w29k30uCbQE)). The game can be used for
in-class, remote, or hybrid teaching and learning for 8^th^ to 11^th^
grade students. 

## Research Base:

Our first large scale study showed using the embedded
physics videos as a support had a significant, positive impact on
students' physics learning, game performance, and enjoyment. Since, we
have examined the impact of affective supports on learning and interest
in science. We expect the affective supports to fuel motivation when
students succeed and encourage persistence when they fail. Moreover, we
finalized a [quit-prediction
model](http://myweb.fsu.edu/vshute/pdf/ICQE_PP_Quit.pdf) to help
determine if a student is going to quit in the next 20 seconds. If so,
the game could intervene with a suitable affective support to help the
student continue playing. We also investigated the effects of several
types of in-game affective supports including motivational messages and
automated affect detectors (i.e., interaction-based vs. webcam-based
detectors). Over the past 6 years we conducted multiple [usability
studies](http://myweb.fsu.edu/vshute/pdf/IJAIED2020.pdf) with over 300
8th to 11th graders from K-12 schools located at various sites (Florida,
Pennsylvania, and New York), and three larger scale experiments. In
Experiment 1 we evaluated the effects of cognitive supports. In
Experiment 2, we investigated the delivery method of the cognitive
supports (i.e., before or after playing a level). In Experiment 3, we
examined the benefits of various affective supports and the effects of
cognitive and affective supports delivery.

## Industry Honors & Awards for Innovation:

A few honors include an NPR
interview with Shute (2020, "Should this exist" podcast), best [student
paper award](http://myweb.fsu.edu/vshute/pdf/Eloy.pdf) at ICMI (2019),
feature article in the [APA Monitor](https://tinyurl.com/y2djn6gm)

Video 2. The manipulation level “Cookie Monster.” In the level, mass and gravity are set to default levels, air resistance is medium, the static blower is in full force, and bounciness is available. To make the ball hit the balloon, players need to reduce air resistance and gravity and enable bounciness.
