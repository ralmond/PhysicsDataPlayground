Video 1. The sketching level “Caveman.” The path of the green ball is blocked by a wooden club. To solve the level, players need to draw a lever to lift the wooden club that blocks the path.

Video 2. The manipulation level “Cookie Monster.” In the level, mass and gravity are set to default levels, air resistance is medium, the static blower is in full force, and bounciness is available. To make the ball hit the balloon, players need to reduce air resistance and gravity and enable bounciness.
