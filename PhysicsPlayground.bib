  abstract = {Game-based assessments produce multiple, dependent observations from student game play. Bayesian networks can model the dependence, but, typically, only a small amount of pilot data are available at the time the network is constructed. This paper examines the process of creating Bayesian network scoring models, focusing on several practical techniques that have been used in the construction of models for Physics Playground. In particular, the following techniques are helpful: (1) The use of evidence-centered assessment design to define latent competency variables and observable indicator variables. (2) The use of correlation matrixes to uncover and validate the conditional independence structure of the Bayes net. (3) The use of discrete IRT models to create large portion of the Bayesian networks from a single spreadsheet. (4) Adjusting the Bayes net parameters using both hand tuning and a generalized EM algorithm, creating networks which are a mixture of expert opinion and data. (5) Using expected classification accuracy matrixes to judge assessment validity and reliability. (6) Using evidence balance sheets to identify unusual subjects and observable indicators.},

Practice has changed a great deal over the past century, in response to evolving conceptions of knowledge and its acquisition, views of schooling and its purposes, and technologies for gathering and evaluating response data. Conceptions of what constitutes assessment data, how it should be interpreted, and what kind of inferences are to be drawn differ radically when cast under different psychological perspectives. If we distinguish the structure of assessment arguments from their substance, we see greater continuity. Developments here have been more in the nature of extension, elaboration, refinement, and explication of argument structures, as they have been prompted by more radical changes in culture and substance.},

  abstract = {Educational assessments that exploit advances in technology and cognitive psychology can produce observations and pose student models that outstrip familiar test-theoretic models and analytic methods. Bayesian inference networks (BINs), which include familiar models and techniques as special cases, can be used to manage belief about students' knowledge and skills, in light of what they say and do. BINs for assessments that add new tasks to their item pools and measure different students with different items can be assembled from building-blocks fragments. A student-model BIN (SM-BIN) fragment contains student model variables, which characterize aspects of knowledge. Evidence model BIN fragments (EM-BINs) contain observable variables and pointers to student model variables. Joining EM-BIN fragments to an SM-BIN fragment permits one to update belief about a student as observations arrive in a setting the EM-BIN was constructed to handle. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques can be used to estimate the conditional probabilities in the BINs from empirical data, supplemented by expert judgment or substantive theory. Details for the special cases of item response theory (IRT) and multivariate latent class modeling are given, with a numerical example of the latter.},

Several psychometric models have been introduced to handle claims cast in information-processing terms, explicitly modeling performance in terms of theory-based predictions of performance. Cognitively based item response theory IRT models incorporate features of items that influence persons' responses, and relate these features to response probabilities. A number of these models are discussed in terms of the interplay between the formal characteristics of the probability models and the substantive narratives they support. Examples include the Linear Logistic Test Model, mixtures of IRT models, and multivariate structured IRT models.},

  abstract = {Tasks are the most visible element in an educational assessment. Their purpose, however, is to provide evidence about targets of inference that cannot be directly seen at all: what examinees know and can do, more broadly conceived than can be observed in the context of any particular set of tasks. This paper concerns issues in assessment design that must be addressed for assessment tasks to serve this purpose effectively and efficiently. The first part of the paper describes a conceptual framework for assessment design, which includes models for tasks. Corresponding models appear for other aspects of an assessment, in the form of a student model, evidence models, an assembly model, a simulator/presentation model, and an interface/environment model. Coherent design requires that these models be coordinated to serve the assessment's purpose. The second part of the paper focuses attention on the task model. It discusses the several roles t h a t task model variables play to achieve the needed coordination in the design phase of an assessment, and to structure task creation and inference in the operational phase.},

  abstract = {The partial credit model (PCM) with a varying slope parameter is developed and called the generalized partial credit model (GPCM). The item step parameter of this model is decomposed to a location and a threshold parameter, following Andrich's (1978) rating scale formulation. The EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters is derived. The performance of this generalized model is compared on both simulated and real data to a Rasch family of polytomous item response models. Simulated data were generated and then analyzed by the various polytomous item response models. The results demonstrate that the rating formulation of the GPCM is quite adaptable to the analysis of polytomous item responses. The real data used in this study consisted of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (Johnson \& Allen, 1992) mathematics data that used both dichotomous and polytomous items. The PCM was applied to these data using both constant and varying slope parameters. The GPCM, which provides for varying slope parameters, yielded better fit to the data than did the PCM.},

  abstract = {Persistence is an important part of student success\textemdash both in and out of school. To enhance persistence, we first need to assess it accurately. Digital games can be used as vehicles for measuring and enhancing persistence. The purpose of this study is to test the effects of (a) game-level characteristics (i.e., game mechanics and conceptual difficulty), and (b) student-related characteristics (e.g., students' incoming knowledge and gender) on persistence in a game called Physics Playground. The participants in this study were 137, eighth and ninth-grade students from a K-12 school in Florida. We used a Hierarchical Linear Modeling Approach (HLM) to analyze the data. The major findings are (1) the degree of difficulty relating to both the physics concepts and game mechanics of each game problem are significant predictors of persistence, with the former being more effective than the latter in predicting students' persistence, and (2) the number of gold and silver trophies students attained in the game were the only significant student-level predictors of persistence. We conclude by discussing the findings, the implications, limitations, and future research related to this study.}

We had 199 9th-11th grade students play a 2D digital STEM learning game across six science classes. Based on the results of demographic surveys, matched pretests and posttests, and satisfaction questionnaires, we found no interaction between gender and ethnicity for performance-based perceived competence, performance, and enjoyment. We found a significant difference between males and females in performance-based perceived competence and in-game performance both favoring males over females. Among ethnic groups, we found a significant difference with in-game performance favoring White and Hispanic students over Black/African American students. However, the differences in gender and in ethnicity were insignificant once we controlled for both perceived competence and pretest scores. This supports the idea that neither race nor gender truly influence one's ability to perform in digital learning games.},

Despite their use, the reliability of examinee estimates in DCM applications has seldom been reported. In this paper, a reliability measure for the categorical latent variables of DCMs is defined. Using theory- and simulation-based results, we show how DCMs uniformly provide greater examinee estimate reliability than IRT models for tests of the same length, a result that is a consequence of the smaller range of latent variable values examinee estimates can take in DCMs. We demonstrate this result by comparing DCM and IRT reliability for a series of models estimated with data from an end-of-grade test, culminating with a discussion of how DCMs can be used to change the character of large scale testing, either by shortening tests that measure examinees unidimensionally or by providing more reliable multidimensional measurement for tests of the same length.},
