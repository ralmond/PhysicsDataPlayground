**Task List**

**[[https://trello.com/b/C7AnI1LP/ies-nsf-project]{.underline}](https://trello.com/b/C7AnI1LP/ies-nsf-project)**

**Research Questions**

1.  Are there any benefits of gameplay + supports vs. gameplay without
    > supports?

2.  Is there any value-added of affective support beyond cognitive
    > support?

**Between subjects**

-   Control

-   Fixed-delivery (prespecified levels and timings)

    -   **Within subjects**

        -   Cognitive only (COG)

        -   Cognitive + affective (COG-AFF)

Counterbalance of COG/COG-AFF to Within subjects condition

counterbalanced across days (EcT-PoT/PoT-Ect)

5 Groups:

Cog only + EcT 1st Day, Cog + Aff + PoT 2nd Day

Cog only + PoT 1st Day, Cog + Aff + EcT 2nd Day

Cog + Aff + EcT 1st Day, Cog Only, PoT 2nd Day

Cog + Aff + PoT 1st Day, Cog Only + EcT 2nd Day

(split the above 4 evenly - 60% of sample; 40% for control)

\* Add "pass" after each test ID for password (e.g., "999ad1pass")

Do cog supports work

A/C Cog vs. A/C Control (within)

Do cog+aff work

B/D CogAff vs. B/D Control (within)

Is there an added advantage of affect (cog + aff) over cog only

A/C vs. B/D (between)

**Schedule**

Day 1: Pretest (14 near + 14 far - PRE), definitions, tutorial levels

Day 2: Gameplay concept 1

Day 3: Gameplay concept 1, posttest concept 1 (7 near + 7 far - POST_C1)

Day 4: Gameplay concept 2

Day 5: Gameplay concept 2, posttest concept 2 (7 near + 7 far - POST_C2)

**Three tests: PRE_BOTH, POST_ECT, POST_POT**

**Within-Level Support Decision Tree**

*\*\*\*Cognitive supports are always present as a hint in the
experimental condition (replace existing hint which points to specific
levels)*

*For control condition, hint merely points to the agent to draw*

IF NOT Tutorial levels OR Warmup levels

IF time_in_lev \>= 2-3 (random) minutes:

IF time_in_game \<= 15 minutes:

Cognitive Support (voluntary)

ELIF time_in_game \> 15 minutes:

IF cond = cogn:

Cognitive Support (voluntary)

ELIF cond = cogn + aff:

Affective Message + Cognitive Support (voluntary)

**Design of supports**

First start with a motivational message (from the qualitative affective
support paper) and then offer the cognitive support as a hint. For
cognitive only, use the cognitive component. For affective, use
affective + cognitive (do not mix/match)

**Between-Level Support Decision Tree**

-   *These rules apply to the first 8 levels where levels are ordered by
    > agent - e.g., ramp1 , ramp 2, springboard 1, springboard 2, etc.*

-   *Note that ramp 1 and ramp 2 share the same support called L1/2.*

-   *Basic intuition is to always provide students in the experimental
    > conditions access to the support for each agent during the level.
    > If they successfully solve a level let them view the support as a
    > reflection (after condition). If they are unsuccessful, let them
    > view it as a hint (before condition)*

-   *~~Before cognitive supports offered prior to even levels (2, 4,
    > etc - within agents)~~*

-   *~~After supports offered after odd levels (1, 3, etc -
    > within-agent)~~*

-   *Between affective supports offered prior to odd levels (in-between
    > agents)*

MESSAGES:

**Before Support:**

\"Before we start, here's a short video that can help you solve levels
like this one.\"

**After Support:**

"Before we move on, here's a short video that can help you solve levels
like this one.\"

*This design resets for each agent. Here level 1 refers to the first
level with a given agent; level 2 refers to the second level with a
given agent.*

For massed levels (1-8 for EcT and 1-6 for PoT)

IF Level1 == solved AND CogSupport for L1/L2 not viewed:

*Reflect Mandatory* : Before going out of Level1 = Cognitive Support for
L1/L2 ;

> *the idea is that they watch the video as form of reflection - an
> **after** support*
>
> ECT_Ramp1 *SUPPORT* -\> ECT_Ramp2
>
> Go to the main menu; Student selects and goes into Level 2;

ELIF Level1 == quit

> Go to the main menu; Student selects and goes into Level 2;

If no_COG viewed for L1/L2

> *Hint* Mandatory: Before starting Level2 = Cognitive Support for L1/L2
>
> *Give them the support as a hint to enable them to solve L2 - as a
> **before** support*
>
> ECT_Ramp1 -\> *SUPPORT* ECT_Ramp2
>
> Else
>
> Do nothing. Let them go to level 2.

For interleaved levels (\> 8 for EcT and \>7 for PoT)

No between levels cognitive supports; these are only provided
within-level

If condition is cognitive + affective and (20 mins of game play or 15
mins since last between affective support offered)

Offer optional calming center or secret store when they hit the main
menu and select the next level

*Idea is to give students a break/reset*

**[Some considerations:]{.mark}**

-   **[Tech issues:]{.mark}** One needs to talk to the IT people there.
    > We need laptops that can allow YouTube videos. Or we need a wifi
    > that our Surface pros can get connected to.

-   **[Instructions:]{.mark}** Students need to be instructed to go
    > through the levels in a linear order. They can choose to replay a
    > level if they want to
